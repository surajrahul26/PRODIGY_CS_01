# PRODGIDY_CS_01 – Implement Caesar Cipher

**Track:** Cybersecurity  
**Task:** Implement a Python program that encrypts and decrypts text using the Caesar Cipher.  
**Files:** `caesar_cipher.py`

## What is Caesar Cipher?
A substitution cipher that shifts each alphabet letter by a fixed number.  
Example (shift = 3): `HELLO → KHOOR`.

## Features
- Encrypt and Decrypt modes
- Preserves case (A–Z / a–z)
- Non-letters (spaces, digits, punctuation) unchanged

## How to Run (No CLI)
1. Open the file in **VS Code** (or any IDE).
2. Click the **Run** button (▶) on top/right of the editor.
3. Enter the message, shift value, and choose encrypt/decrypt when prompted.
